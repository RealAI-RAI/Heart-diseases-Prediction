# Introduction

Heart disease prediction is crucial in healthcare. This project explores different machine learning algorithms to create accurate classifiers for identifying patients at risk.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is stored in the heart.csv file. It contains information about patients, including:

Age
Sex
Chest Pain Type
Resting Blood Pressure
Serum Cholesterol
Fasting Blood Sugar
Resting Electrocardiogram Results
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
Exercise Induced Angina
Oldpeak (ST Depression)
Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
Thalassemia

Target: presence of heart disease (1 for yes, 0 for no)

# Implementation

# Evaluation

Models are evaluated based on accuracy scores calculated on a test set.


# Results

The results show the performance of each implemented model:

Algorithm	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	85.25%
Naive Bayes	85.25%
SVM	81.97%
KNN	67.21%
Decision Tree	81.97%
Random Forest	90.16%
AdaBoost	84.92%
Gradient Boosting	86.39%
XGBoost	85.25%
Neural Network	81.97%

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in predicting heart diseases. The Random Forest model performed best, achieving high accuracy. Future improvements could involve feature selection and hyperparameter tuning.
